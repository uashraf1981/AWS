# AWS Key Management Service (KMS)

*If you HAVE compliance requirements and want to ensure that only you manage your keys, then use AWS CloudHSM*

*If you DON'T have compliance requirements, and want easier management for your keys, then use AWS KMS*

The basic idea is that you encrypt your data with the *Data Key*, but then you need to encrypt the data key as well. So you use a *Master Key* to encrypt your data key and AWS KMS stores the Master Key.

** Remember the scope of keys is always a region **

KMS Master Keys
---------------
AWS KMS Customer Master Keys (CMK) are *AES-256* *symmetric encoded* keys which never leave KMS and while a client can manipulate the Master Keys, it can never see the actual contents of the key itself. The client can create, delete and apply policies to who has access to Customer Master Keys (CMK). Typically used to encrypt/decrypt data encryption keys. It can encrypt data chunks as well but maximum of 4KB chunks.

Master keys are of two types:

1. Customer-Managed Customer Master Key (CMK): Generated by Customer, rotated every year, can be deleted and most importantly, key access policy determined by the customer.

2. AWS-Managed Customer Master Key (CMK): Generated by AWS, rotated every three years, cannot be deleted and most importantly, key access policy determined by AWS.

KMS Master Key Policies
-----------------------
You can specify the exact policies e.g.

- can be used for encryption/decryption by these users in these accounts
- can be used by applicatioin A to encrypt data only and application B to decrypt data only
- can be managed by this administrator
- you can even allow access from other accounts

Data Encryption Keys
--------------------
When you generate the data key using the Master Key by calling the *GenerateDataKey* API of the KMS, then both a plaintext version and an encrypted version of the key are produced. Plaintext version used to encrypt data then deleted. The encrypted version is stored along with data for the next time that you may need to decrypt your EBS volume or data.

The Data Encryption Keys are use to encrypt the actual data on EBS or EFS e.g. and then the data keys are also encrypted using the Master key and also stored with the data itself.

Monitoring and Compliance
-------------------------
AWS KMS is integrated with CloudTrail for all cryptographic operations so you can deliver files to an Amazon S3 bucket and  which you can later track and audit for compliance.

Programming the AWS KMS API
---------------------------
You can use the AWS KMS API to generate, delete, rotate keys, to encrypt decrypt data (although data keys recommended for data encryption), to encrypt and decrypt data keys and many more. You have to specify the ARN of the CMK that is to be used for encrypting the data key AND also specify the AES standard to be used.
